# Computer-Security-Seed-Labs
 This is the coursework from my Computer Security class where I completed Seed Labs that demonstrated the understanding of a vast amount of cybersecurity concepts.
## Getting Started

These instructions will get you to set up the environment on your local machine to perform these attacks.

Step 1: Create a new VM in Virtual Box.\
Step 2: Download the image [SEEDUbuntu-16.04-32bit.zip](https://seedsecuritylabs.org/lab_env.html) from here.\
Step 3: Use the Virtual Machine Hard Disk file to setup your VM.\
Step 4: Configure the VM.

The [link](https://seedsecuritylabs.org/lab_env.html) contains a document that can be used to set up the VM without any issues.

## Motivation
The labs were completed as a part of the Computer Security course at University of Texas at Dallas. The course is well structured to understand the concepts of Computer Security.

## Key Learnings

- These attack labs give us the idea of fundamental principles of computer system security, including authentication, access control, capability leaking, security policies, sandbox, software vulnerabilities, and web security.

- Identifying the vulnerabilities and exploiting them. Further work on countermeasures as a security solution to the problem.

## List of Attacks

1. **Buffer Overflow Vulnerability**

2. **Secret Key Encryption Lab **
> 
3. **RSA Public-Key Encryption and Signature Lab **

4. **Heartbleed Attack Lab **
